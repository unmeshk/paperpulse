Paper Pulse summarizes the daily AI/ML (cs.AI, cs. CL, cs.LG, and cs.CV) activity on ArXiv. It uses the OpenAI API to summarize papers and identify important themes as well as any new and interesting work. 
These results are not hand-checked so it is possible that some parts of the summary might be hallucinated. 
The ArXiv API is usually a day or so behind so the latest results will only show up in a couple of days. 

<strong> Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability. </strong>

### Current Model:
GPT-4o-mini
